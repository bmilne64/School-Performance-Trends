# School Performance Trends 
In this project, I analyzed district-wide standardized test results and aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

First, I merged two csv files of data and created a dataframe for the district including total number of schools and students, total budget and test score averages. 

Second, I created a dataframe that summarizes key metrics about each school, including School Name, School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing. 

Next, I sorted and displayed the top five and bottom five performing schools by % overall passing.

Then, I created a table that lists the average reading score and a table that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Finally, I created three tables that break down school performances based on average spending ranges per student, school size and school type.
